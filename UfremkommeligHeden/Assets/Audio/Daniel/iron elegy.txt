Iron Elegy
Af Daniel H (DX2)

Harp strings cry (they cry)
Melodies clash with the sky
With each note, weâ€™re born anew
Flute whispers high, (so high)
Violin screams in this fire
Eternal, this metal brew
Drums rage on (they beat)
Thunderous heart of the storm
Guitar wails in the dragon's lair
Crashing cymbals, lightning's form
Sirens wail through the air
In the forge where metal's born
Bass lines roar (they roar)
Echoes deep from the core
With each strum, the world's remade
Keys ignite, sparks rain down (sparkle on)
As the organ joins the hound
In the anthem of the heavy brigade
Horns of battle (sound the horns)
Call to arms under the sky
Every chord, a warrior's vow
As the pipes sing, carry on (onward march)
Bass drum beats like it's the end
Fury unleashed in waves unbound
