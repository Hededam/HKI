I tried to kancho a dragon
Af Daniel H (DX2)

We're breathin' fire, we're breathin' fire
We're breathin' fire, but I missed the beast with desire
Crunch, crack, snap
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I got pain, I got pain
Dragon's scales, they didn't, didn't take my aim
I got splints, I got casts
I got scars that are gonna last
Shot my shot, misfire, blast
Bones crackle like a dragon's roar
Missed the mark, but I'll come back for more
[Chorus]
Fists of fury, aimed for the sky
But I missed, now I scream, not fly
I'm standing tall, I'm standing fierce
Against the scales, my fists I pierce
But the beast, it just sneers, it just jeers
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the agony, the agony
Dragon's laugh echoing my calamity
I got wraps, I got spikes
Dragons breath, fire burns my pride
My attack, all in vain, I tried
Crash, thud, fall
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm writhing, I'm writhing
Dragon's glare has me, has me fighting
I got splits, I got splints
I got bruised, I made the lists
On dragon's hide, my kancho twist
But I thrust, and I missed, what a shame
Now my fingers shattered, got no one to blame
[Chorus]
I'm the fool, the one who dared
Used kancho on scales, wasn't prepared
Blackened sky, the thunder roars (the thunder roars)
I stood with valor, now I'm floored
Metal clanks, adrenaline rush
Heavy heart, the silence hush
[Verse 3]
Armor smashed against dragon hide
Bones shattered, can't turn the tide
