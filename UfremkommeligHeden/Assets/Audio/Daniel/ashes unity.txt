Ashes Unity
Af Daniel H (DX2)

Stay by my side
In these ashes, hope's alight
We ay ay
Together stronger, we won't sway
In love's embrace
[Post-Chorus: Member]
Through the pain
Hand in hand, we'll rise above
Rebuild our dreams, transform our love
Say ay ay
With every heartbeat, we'll convey
A brighter dawn
[Breakdown: Member]
From the rubble, we claim our day
See the skyline (skyline)
Bearing scars, yet we stand
Brave a-a-ay
Hands united, our spirits undying
We found grace
[Pre-Chorus]
In unity
Underneath these stars (these stars)
We find strength, heal our hearts
We sa-a-ay
From the darkness, we've found our way
In hopeâ€™s embrace (embrace)
[Chorus: Group]
With every tear, a seed of growth
Through the sorrow, our faith won't break (won't break)
The skyline's changed, but our dreams awake (dreams awake)
Hold on strong, this city's brave (city's brave)
Love's the anthem, as we march and say (march and say)
[Bridge: Group]
We'll light up the night
With our courage, with our pride
[Ending Chorus: Group]
Watch us rise from the ground
Like phoenix wings spread 'round
We'll shout, we'll play
New York's heart pulses, our eternal flame (eternal flame)
Silver linings we trace, with every step we take (step we take)
The skyline shines, reflecting dreams that never fade (dreams that never fade)
