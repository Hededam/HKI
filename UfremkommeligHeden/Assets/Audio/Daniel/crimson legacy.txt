Crimson legacy
Af Daniel H (DX2)

Honor's sword, now laid to rest
Underneath the crimson sky
Ancestors call from the distant past
With every strum, their spirits fly
Guide me to the shrine above
With the cherry blossoms blown
On fields of green, farewell my love
Shadows cast from the gates arise
Legends whisper through the rustling leaves
In the silence, a warriorâ€™s sigh
At the mountain's base, I kneel, I vow
To the fading light, I take my bow
Echoes sound, the war drums cease
On ancestral winds, I find my peace
The blade once drawn, now sheathed in still
Meets the earth, my oath fulfilled
In the heart where honor lies
With the stars, my spirit flies
Through the temple gates, I make my path
Forged in fire, through the aftermath
Dragon's roar and tiger's fierce embrace
Metal screams in this sacred space
[Chorus]
Rising sun on my steel, my final stand
In this ageless realm, I clasp my hands
[Verse 2]
Ancient rites, lit by lantern's glow
To the gods, my head I bow
Shamisen cries blend with wailing shred
Fortitude in every thread
[Pre-Chorus]
Through the torii gates, echoes of fate
An end of an era, sealed by hate
Veiled night falls upon the land
Steel to heart, the final command
Blood-stained honor fades to black
The samurai's time won't come back
[Chorus]
Whispers of death, a merciless end
In the shadows, our spirits ascend
